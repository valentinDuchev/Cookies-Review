              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                Cookies began with a simple passion for baking. Our founder, Jane Smith, started baking cookies in her
                home kitchen, sharing them with friends and family who couldn't get enough of her delicious creations.
              </p>
              <p>
                What started as a hobby quickly grew into a small business as word spread about these incredible
                cookies. In 2010, Jane opened her first small bakery, and Cookies was born.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we've grown into a beloved brand known for our commitment to quality, taste, and the joy that
                comes from a perfect cookie. While we've expanded, we still bake each cookie with the same care and
                attention to detail as Jane did in her home kitchen.
